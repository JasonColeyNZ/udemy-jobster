This is a course project from the Udemy Learn React by Building 25+ Interesting Projects

The course was is js but I decided to use typescript in the project, now I'm not a typescript professional, so its only basic typescript usage.

When I get some free time after more Typescript training I'll come back to this and enable the strict flag.
